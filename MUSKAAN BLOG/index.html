      <h2>
        I want to write a blog where I tell how I'm learning web development,
        how should I start?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught Web Developer and I say â€“ The Best way to learn
        Web Development is to learn by yourself. As with any other programming
        language / web script, the learning process of Web development should be
        started from Beginners level to Intermediate level and then finally
        the Advanced level.
      </p>
      <h2>Biggest Mistake which Developers do:</h2>
      What many students/developers make mistake is that they keep on reading
       tutorials one by one, and do not implement any of them. This
      way of learning is totally wrong and futile. Students should read one
      tutorial then implement what the tutorial has taught them, in their own
      code. This will make them understand the code correctly, otherwise I
      guarantee they will forget what they just read within the next 30
      minutes or before.

          <h5>Accessibility Tips for Web Developers</h5>
        </a>
        <p >
          It's awesome to build sites that are inclusive and accessible to everyone. There are at least six key
          areas of
          disability we can optimize for: visual, hearing, mobility, cognition, speech and neural. Many tools
          and resources can
          help here, even if you're totally new to web accessibility.

        <p >
          Nowadays, it's hard to profoundly talk about security in the IT industry, since it has to be
          considered on so many
          different levels: from securing code chunks, securing containers, up to securing complex
          infrastructures and defining
          strong authorization and authentication policies across the enterprise.

          <h5>Don't Develop Just for Yourself - A Developer's Checklist to Accessibility</h5>
        </a>
        <p >
          We, as developers, tend to develop sites unconsciously for people like ourselves. If we don't actively
          pay attention,
          the sites are often accessible only for certain types of people: Sighted mouse-users, who have good
          fine motor skills
          and are good at using computers.

          <h5>Building a Restful CRUD API with Node JS, Express, and MongoDB</h5>
        </a>
        <p >
          Application Programming Interface is the abbreviation for API. An API is a software interface that
          enables two apps to
          communicate with one another. In other words, an API is a messenger that sends your request to the
          provider and then
          returns the response to you.
